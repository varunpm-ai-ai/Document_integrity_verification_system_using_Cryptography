# Document_integrity_verification_system_using_Cryptography
Verifying the integrity of the documents using Cryptography 
## Overview

A system to verify document integrity using standard cryptographic primitives. It provides a reproducible workflow to compute cryptographic digests, sign those digests, and verify signatures so you can detect accidental corruption or malicious tampering.

## Features

- Compute content digests (SHA-2 / SHA-3 family)
- Create and verify digital signatures (RSA / ECDSA) and HMAC-based MACs
- Generate, import and use key pairs (private/public) for signing and verification
- Produce compact signature artifacts alongside files for easy storage and transport
- Audit-friendly output for logs and CI/CD pipelines
- Clear separation of hashing, signing and verification steps for reproducibility

## Supported algorithms (typical)

- Hash: SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA3-256
- Asymmetric: RSA-2048/4096, ECDSA (P-256, P-384)
- Symmetric: HMAC-SHA256

(Exact supported algorithms depend on the implementation in this repository.)

## Typical workflow

1. Compute a digest for the file content (deterministic canonicalization if needed).
2. Sign the digest with a private key to produce a signature artifact.
3. Store or transmit the original file plus the signature (and public key identifier).
4. To verify: recompute the digest and validate the signature using the corresponding public key.

This design keeps verification deterministic and independent of file metadata.

## Getting started

Prerequisites
- A recent runtime / interpreter used by this project (check repo files for language and version)
- Cryptographic backend (OpenSSL / libs provided by the chosen language)
- Access to a private key for signing and a public key for verification

Quick steps
1. Install dependencies according to the repository’s instructions (e.g., pip/npm/dotnet/apt instructions in project files).
2. Generate or provide key material (private and public keys).
3. Use the provided CLI or library functions to hash, sign and verify documents.

## Usage patterns

Hash-only (integrity check)
- Compute a digest and store it securely alongside the file. Compare digests to detect changes.

Signed integrity (non-repudiation)
- Sign the digest with a private key. Verifiers use the corresponding public key to confirm integrity and author.

HMAC-based verification (shared key)
- Use HMAC when both sender and receiver share a secret and asymmetric keys are not required.

Examples (conceptual)
- Compute digest: compute_digest file -> writes SHA-256
- Sign digest: sign_digest --key private.pem digest -> writes digest.sig
- Verify: verify_signature --pub public.pem digest digest.sig -> returns OK/ERROR

(Replace above conceptual commands with the concrete CLI/library calls provided in this repository.)

## Key management and security notes

- Keep private keys offline and access-controlled.
- Use hardware-backed key stores (HSM / TPM / cloud KMS) for production signing when possible.
- Rotate keys and keep a clear key identifier policy to allow verification of older artifacts.
- Protect digest and signature artifacts with integrity and access controls (they are sensitive indicators of provenance).

## Storage & auditability

- Store signature metadata (algorithm, key id, timestamp) with each artifact for reliable verification later.
- Include provenance fields (who signed, why, and which version of signing tool) to support audits.
- Consider an append-only audit log (file or remote service) for traceability.

## Testing

- Unit tests should cover: hashing determinism, signature generation and verification, edge cases (empty files, large files), and error handling.
- Integration tests should validate end-to-end workflows (hash → sign → verify) across supported algorithms.
- Include regression tests for canonicalization or normalization behavior if file transformations are possible.

## CI/CD recommendations

- Verify that CI runners have deterministic tooling versions for hashing and signing.
- Run verification steps on produced artifacts as part of release pipelines.
- Keep signing operations off public CI; use a secure signing mechanism (delegated KMS/HSM) when producing official releases.
